Our project entails the sending of pictures between “senders,” most likely grandkids and distant relatives, to “receivers,” most likely grandparents or other distant relatives.  Our concept, #kinnect, will pull images from Social Media and local photos, present a screening/ veto step for Senders, and then batch send them to the Receiver.  Receivers will them view them on the simplest of interfaces, most likely just a scrolling photo real accessible via hyperlink.
